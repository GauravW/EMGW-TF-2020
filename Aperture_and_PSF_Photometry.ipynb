We detect photons from the source onto a CCD camera and measure the number of photon collected in a given time. An estimation of photon flux from any particular source gives us its brightness. In astronomy we represents it in terms of magnitude of a source. Magnitude is represented as:\n",

Number of photons collected by camera greatly depends on its specification and telescope assembly. Hence, this magnitude cooresponds to a particular camera assembly. Different cameras may register different Flux for the same source depending on various factors. Hence, the instrumental magnitude may vary with camera. As instrumental magnitude is not a standard thing we cannot use it directly on global scale. Therefore, we have to standardise it. We will do that later. Let's first understand how to estimate the instrumental magnitude."

These parameters are usally stored in the configuration file. `SExtractor` sources detection methods has been trained on various telescope images and are quite reliable. Although there exist better algorithms to perform photometry on sources, hardly any other software is as reliable as `SExtractor` in detecting sources.
